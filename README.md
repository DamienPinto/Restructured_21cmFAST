# Restructured_21cmFAST
This is just repository consisting of the 21cmFAST code made by Andrei Mesinger, Steven Furlanetto, and Renyue Cen
but with all the whitespace redone to improve code readability.

Other changes have been done such as adding end tags to make longer loops identifiable without scrolling all the way to their beginning, eliminating useless spaces, making sure the number of spaces in a tab/whitespace (2 paces per tab) is standard among all files, etc...

As of now, only the files within the "Programs" directory have been reworked. The files with the suffix "_original.c" are the original files provided by an install of 21cmFAST without any changes done. This is provided in case I messed something up. The files with the typical file names are the retouched ones, they have the standard file names so that they can be used normally. If there is no "*original.c" version of a file then that is one of the few I did before realising that preserving the originals would be a good idea. You will have to go get those from an original installation of 21cmFAST.

Hope this has been helpful!
